DHCPig
======


SUMMARY
-------

DHCPig initiates an advanced DHCP exhaustion attack. It will consume all IPs on the LAN, stop new users from obtaining IPs,
release any IPs in use, then for good measure send gratuitous ARP and knock all windows hosts offline.

It requires scapy >=2.1 library and admin privileges to execute. No configuration necessary, just pass the interface as 
a parameter. It has been tested on multiple Linux distributions and multiple DHCP servers (ISC,Windows 2k3/2k8,..).


When executed the script will perform the following actions:

* Grab your Neighbors IPs before they do   
	Listen for DHCP Requests from other clients if offer detected, respond with request for that offer.   

* Request all available IP addresses in Zone   
	Loop and Send DHCP Requests all from different hosts & MAC addresses  

* Find your Neighbors MAC & IP and release their IP from DHCP server   
	ARP for all neighbors on that LAN, then send DHCPReleases to server   
	

Finally the script will then wait for DHCP exhaustion, (that is no received DHCP OFFERs for 10 seconds)  and then 


* Knock all Windows systems offline   
	gratuitous ARP the LAN, and since no additional DHCP addresses are available these windows systems should stay 
offline.  Linux systems will not give up IP even when another system on LAN is detected with same IP.


USAGE
-----
DHCP exhaustion attack plus.   

    Usage:   
      pig.py [-d -h] <interface>   
        -h                this help display   
        -d                enable debug   


EXAMPLE
-------

    ./piy.py eth1



DEFENSE
-------

most common approach to defending DHCP exhaustion is via access layer switching or wireless controllers.  

In cisco switching simplest option is to enable DHCP snooping.  Snooping will defend against pool exhaustion,
IP hijacking, and DHCP sever spoofing  all of which are used in DHCPig.   Based on examined traffic, DHCP 
snooping will create a mapping table from IP to mac on each port.  User access ports are then restricted to only 
the given IP.  Any DHCP server messages originating from untrusted ports are filtered.


enable the following to defend against pool exhaustion, IP hijacking, and DHCP sever spoofing:

* enable snooping 

    `ip dhcp snooping`
    
* specify which port your DHCP is associated with.  Most likely this is your uplink.  Doing the following will 
limit DHCP server responses to only the specified port, so use after testing in lab environment.

    `int fa0/1`  (or correct interface)

    `ip dhcp snooping trust`

* show status

    `show ip dhcp snopping`

    `show ip dhcp snopping binding`
